I swapped out my RalliTek overload springs with Ironman lift springs. Let the comparison begin! I get a 1/4\" more lift than the RalliTeks. Riding significantly higher than the standard Kings that I had previously. It'll probably settle after time. Both the RalliTek and the Ironman springs ride better than the Kings. I'm noticing a stiffer ride with the Ironman springs than with the RalliTeks. I took pictures of the RalliTeks and the Ironmans. It's been a while since I ran the Kings so I didn't get a picture of them installed. I am running 235/75r15 with about 300lbs of extra weight (custom rear bumper/ARB fridge/2 20L jerrycans/fullsize spare tire).\"/>",
