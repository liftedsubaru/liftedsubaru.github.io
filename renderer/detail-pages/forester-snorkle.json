The process doesn't look too difficult, just take your time measuring. Use tape first to keep the paint fresh and to allow for you to make marks if needed. \r\n<img src=\"../static/img/guides/forester-snorkle2.jpg\"/>\r\n<img src=\"../static/img/guides/forester-snorkle5.jpg\"/><img src=\"../static/img/guides/forester-snorkle3.jpg\"/>\r\n<img src=\"../static/img/guides/forester-snorkle4.jpg\"/>\r\n</p>"]
