      "<p><em>Submitted to Lifted Subarus by Will Clarkson</em>, originally published in Classic Ford Magazine.</p>",
      "<p>The Weber 32/36 DGV and DGAV carburettors were fitted to a whole host of classic Fords (<em>and subarus</em>), and many have since been retrospectively fitted as a useful performance upgrade. The carbs are easy to set-up and maintain, however like most things in life they do benefit from some tlc from time to time â€“ either a service or a full rebuild. Fortunately, service kits and replacement parts such as jets, diaphragms and valves are all still readily available from the likes of Webcon direct and Weber dealers.</p>"
