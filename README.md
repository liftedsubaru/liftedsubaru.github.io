## Features
Searchable tiling for articles linked to raw sources with a PDF archive of the thread or build writeup.

Renderer Directory builds the static files from configs and handlebars templates

Create a sitemap and update file via www.xml-sitemaps.com

```

  cd renderer
  node index.js <-- builds html from json found in renderer/detail-pages

```

I'm doing it this way to keep the site free and static serving from Github Pages

## Detail Pages Config Format
